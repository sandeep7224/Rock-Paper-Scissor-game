Rock-Paper-Scissor-game

This program simulates the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game. It utilizes Python's random module to generate the computer's choice. The user enters their selection ("Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors") through input prompts. Conditional statements determine the winner based on winning combinations (Rock crushes Scissors, Scissors cut Paper, Paper covers Rock). The program announces ties and victors accordingly.  This code demonstrates basic user input, random number generation, and conditional logic, making it a great introduction to Python game development.
